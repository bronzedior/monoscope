            US strikes in the west of Iraq against armed pro-Iran groups killed at least 16 people,
            including civilians, and wounded 23, Iraqi government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi said on
            Saturday.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                US strikes in the west of Iraq against armed pro-Iran groups killed at least 16 people, including
                civilians, and wounded 23, Iraqi government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi said on Saturday.
                The strikes hit "locations in the Akashat and Al-Qaim regions, including areas where our security forces
                are stationed", Awadi said in a statement.

                The United States carried out the strikes on Friday in retaliation for the killing of three US military
                personnel in a drone attack on a base close to Jordan's border with Syria and Iraq.

            <p>
                Washington blamed the unclaimed attack on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran
                fighters opposed to US support for Israel in Gaza.

                Tehran has denied any links to the attack.

                On Friday, a White House spokesperson said the United States had "warned the Iraqi government before the
                strikes".

                But Baghdad denied there had been any coordination with Washington prior to the bombings.

                Awadi accused the United States of "deception and distortion of facts" and called the suggestion "an
                unfounded claim crafted to mislead international public opinion and evade legal responsibility" for what
                he said was a breach of international law.

                "This aggressive air strike will push the security situation in Iraq and the region to the brink of the
                abyss," the spokesman said.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Awadi condemned the use of Iraq's territory as a "battleground for settling scores" and repeated his
                government's call for the withdrawal of the US-led international anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq.

                The coalition had "deviated from its assigned tasks and granted mandate," he said, and was "endangering
                security and stability in Iraq".

                There are roughly 2,500 US troops deployed in Iraq and about 900 in Syria as part of the coalition
                formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group -- the year the jihadist group overran around a third of
                Iraq.

                Since mid-October, there have been more than 165 drone and rocket attacks against coalition troops in
                Iraq and Syria, with most being claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.
